# AVG_Script
A simple script for calculating the average of three numbers

This particular script is designed to take three input values from the user, append them to an array, calculate the average of the array, and finally print the array as well as its length. Essentially, it's a way to streamline a simple mathematical process and get some practice working with arrays in bash. As always, feel free to adapt the script to your own needs - that's part of the fun of coding! Happy scripting.
